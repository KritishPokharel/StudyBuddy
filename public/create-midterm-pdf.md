# How to Create a PDF from the Sample Midterm

You can use the sample midterm files in several ways:

## Option 1: Use the Text File Directly
The file `sample-midterm-cs3.txt` can be uploaded directly. The OCR will extract the text.

## Option 2: Convert to PDF
1. Open `sample-midterm-cs3-formatted.md` in a markdown viewer
2. Print to PDF (File > Print > Save as PDF)
3. Upload the PDF

## Option 3: Create an Image
1. Take a screenshot of the formatted markdown
2. Save as PNG/JPG
3. Upload the image

## Option 4: Use Online Tools
- Copy the content from `sample-midterm-cs3-formatted.md`
- Paste into Google Docs or Word
- Export as PDF
- Upload to the application

## Expected Results After Analysis

The system should identify:
- **Question 1:** Partially correct (8/10) - Topic: Sorting Algorithms
- **Question 2:** Incorrect (0/10) - Topic: Graph Traversal
- **Question 3:** Incorrect (0/10) - Topic: Algorithm Analysis
- **Question 4:** Partially correct (6/10) - Topic: Binary Trees
- **Question 5:** Correct (10/10) - Topic: Dynamic Programming

**Error Topics Identified:**
- Graph Traversal
- Algorithm Analysis
- Binary Trees (partial)
- Sorting Algorithms (partial)

**Recommended Resources:** Should include materials on DFS/BFS, time complexity analysis, and BST operations.
